    			<h2>How it works</h2>
    			<p>
    				"Repetition is the mother of learning", says Latin proverb. And this is indeed true, because before some information sinks in your brain, you must repeatedly use it for some time.

    				<a href="/">Mnesis</a> will ask you to remember information that you learnt, so that eventually it will be memorized firmly.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Chunks of information are usually memorized in groups, which contain at least two elements, e.g. word and translation, date and event, country and its capital city etc. Sometimes these groups can contain additional elements, like phonetic transcription of a word, or examples of its usage. In <a href="/">Mnesis</a>, these groups are called <i>entries</i>, and elements of an entry are called <i>keys</i>.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Entries are groupped into lists, called <i>dictionaries</i> (so entry keys are also <i>dictionary keys</i>). You can create dictionaries for specific themes, like "events of the Punic Wars", or for more broad ones, like "Spanish words".
    			</p>
    			<p>Memorizing can be thought of as establishing a link between what you already know and a thing being memorized (e.g. native language word and a foreign word, name of a physical constant and its value). During dictionary creation known keys should be marked as <i>"Show in training"</i>, and those which yet are not as <i>"Show as a hint"</i>.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Once you filled a dictionary with entries and some time is passed, return to it and hit <i>"Start training"</i>; then, when presented with element(s) of an entry (like native word), try to remember respective hidden element (like foreign word). If you succeeded, go to the next entry by pressing <i>"I know it"</i> button, and if not, hit <i>"Show hint"</i>. Return to your dictionaries regularly, and, hopefully, that will help you in your learning.
